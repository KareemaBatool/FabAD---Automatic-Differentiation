    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiation is defined as the process of finding the gradients/derivatives of a particular function in hand. It finds multiple applications in the areas of science and engineering. With the exponential growth in the size of the dataset and advancements in technologies - the complexity of computing derivatives has increased and we have become increasingly dependent on computers to compute derivatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there are three ways to compute derivatives - finite, symbolic, automatic differentiation. The finite differentiation method although being quick and easy to implement - suffers from machine precision and rounding errors. We are able to alleviate these issues using symbolic differentiation, however, it becomes computationally very expensive as the function(s) starts to get complex. We are able to alleviate both the issues of computational complexity and machine precision using automatic differentiation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Differentiation leverages symbolic rules for evaluating gradients - which is more accurate than using finite difference approximations. But unlike a purely symbolic process, the evaluation of expressions takes place early in the computation - it evaluates derivatives at particular numeric values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The package fab-AD implements automatic differentiation for computational use. fabAD can be used to automatically differentiate functions via forward mode. Automatic Differentiation finds applications in optimization, machine learning, and numerical methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Background\n",
    "### 2.1 An overview of Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation (also known as autodiff, AD, or algorithmic differentiation) is a widely used tool in optimization. There are two ways in which we can calculate the derivative of a function. If it is  totally new function, we can use the limit definition to derive it. However, most of the time  a function is just a composition of old (seen) functions and in this case we can use chain rule to derive the new function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation provides the benefit of avoiding the symbolic manipulation of functions while achieving machine-like precision. Automatic differentiation has applications in astronomy, dynamic systems, numerical analytical research, optimization in finance and engineering, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "AD is based on the concept of decomposing a function into a series of simple operations and functions whose derivatives are readily attainable, and then sequentially applying the chain rule to assess the derivatives of these operations to calculate the derivative of the entire function. This eliminates the difficulty of parsing and memorizing the entire symbolic expression, allowing us to keep simply the function's value and its derivative at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two primary strategies for automated distinction are forward mode and reverse mode. These two modes are identical in terms of precision, but they may differ in terms of efficiency when the size of the input data grows. Forward mode is often more effective when working with complicated functions or a large number of functions. Some AD algorithms even implement both forward mode and reverse mode. For this project, our package implements solely the forward mode and is a valuable resource for applications such as dynamic systems and mechanical engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better comprehend automated differentiation, let's first familiarize ourselves with several essential principles employed in the AD algorithms. We will use the remainder of this section to introduce them quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Elementary operations and functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation's algorithm reduces functions to simple arithmetic operations and elementary functions. The fundamental arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (we can also consider taking roots of a number as raising it to powers less than ). Among the elementary functions are exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric. These operations and functions have easily calculable derivates, thus we employ them as elementary evaluation stages in the AD evaluation trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 The chain rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule permits the decomposition of complex, nested functions into layers of operations. Our automated differentiation algorithm sequentially computes the derivative of functions using the chain rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule can be used to calculate the derivate of nested functions, such in the form of $u(v(t))$. For this function, the derivative of $u$ with respect to $t$ is $$\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial v}\\dfrac{\\partial v}{\\partial t}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A more general form of chain rule applies when a function $h$ has several arguments, or when its argument is a vector. Suppose we have $h = h(y(t))$ where  $y \\in R^n$ and $t \\in R^m $. Here, $h$ is the combination of $n$ functions, each of which has $m$ variables. Using the chain rule, the derivative of $h$ with respect to $t$, now called the gradient of $h$, is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla_{t}h = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y_{i}}\\nabla y_{i}\\left(t\\right)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Evaluation Trace and Computational Graph\n",
    "Our approach for automated differentiation is founded on the concepts of evaluation trail and computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation trace traces each operation layer while the input function and its derivative are evaluated. The evaluation trace contains the traces, elementary operations, numeric values, elementary derivatives, and partial derivatives at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational graph represents the evaluation path graphically. It contains the traces and elementary operations of all the stages, linking them with arrows leading from the input to the output of each step, allowing us to better comprehend the function's structure and evaluation trail. In forward mode, operations are executed from the beginning to the conclusion of a graph or evaluation trace. Reverse mode executes the processes in reverse, applying the chain rule each time to get the trace's derivative.\n",
    "For example, we have a function:\n",
    "$$f(x,y, z) = x*y + z$$\n",

    "Specificly speaking, the README file would contain a general package description and the necessary information for users to navigate in the subdirectories. The `docs` directory include our previous milestones documentation, and would further our documentation and testing api.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, to package our model with PyPI, we would include `setup.py` and `fab_ad` directory in `src` directory, where  the source code of our package would be stored. These core modules include: `fab_ad.py`, `fab_admath.py` and `constants.py` . Furthermore, we would put a collection of test cases in `tests` directory. The tests are run through Pytest. Last but not least, we would include `test.yml` and `coverage.yml` in our home directory for integrated test. In addition, we would also include a simple tutorial `demo.ipynb` for demo of our code in the home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To distribute our package, we would use PyPI so that users could easily install the package with pip install.\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing the package, users can use `from fab_ad import FabTensor` to import the package. These two modules are where the core of this package resides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `fab_ad`: defines the fab_ad object class that we use to perform automatic differentiation and overwrites basic math operation dunder methods for AD. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `fab_admath`: defines functions that perform elementary math operations on AD, which include those that cannot be performed by overwriting dunder methods, such as logarithm and trigonometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Details about the implementation including usage and purpose of each class and method was generated using sphinx and is hosted on GitHub pages. Current implementation of our AD library involves the first derivative of a scalar function w.r.t each independent variable/seed vector or a linear combination of the seed vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core modules in the implementation are fab_ad and fab_admath. fab_ad module contains the FabTensor class which is the main data structure used. Data members and properties of the FabTensor class are value, derivative, and identifier. Value is the primal trace, derivative is an array which contains first order derivative w.r.t each seed vector, and identifier is the function expression. Each step of evaluation of the derivative/value for the function expression results in a new FabTensor object which is computed and initialized in the implemented methods for each mathematical operation. fab_ad module also contains basic overridden inequality methods, len method that returns the number of independent variables, five basic overridden methods for elementary mathematical operations - add, subtract, multiply, divide, and power, and the directional_derivative method which computes the derivative w.r.t a given seed vector. fab_admath module contains other more complex mathematical operators and functions such as sigmoid, sin, arcsin, sqrt, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next milestone we plan on adding a few more math functions - trigonometric (cosec, sec, cot) and hyperbolic. Also, the current implementation only computes the first order derivative for a scalar function. As part of the extension for this project we plan on implementing higher order and mixed derivatives of vector functions. Specifically we will implement the Hessian matrix which includes the derivative of a function twice w.r.t each independent variable (similar to the Laplacian operator) and mixed derivatives (i.e. derivative w.r.t one independent variable followed by another independent variable).\n",
    " \n",
    "## 6. Future Features\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the extension for this project we plan on implementing higher order and mixed derivatives of vector functions. Specifically we will implement the Hessian matrix which includes the derivative of a function twice w.r.t each independent variable (similar to the Laplacian operator) and mixed derivatives (i.e. derivative w.r.t one independent variable followed by another independent variable). Currently, we have implemented only the first derivative of a function w.r.t all the seed vectors/independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the derivative data member of FabTensor object is a 1D array. This would change to 2D array to accommodate the Hessian matrix. Also, we would have to update each of our elementary math functions to return the second derivatives by taking the derivative of the first derivative. The main challenge here will be to efficiently compute the second derivatives from the first derivatives by reusing most of the code already written and using a helper function to call the same derivative function twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Directory structure would remain the same. Modules and classes would also remain the same because we don't need a new class to implement the second derivative. We would need a new method in the fab_ad class to call the derivative for the second time (derivative of the first derivative). Also, we would have to update each of our elementary math functions to return the second derivatives. Data structure of the derivative member of the FabTensor class would change from being a 1D array to 2D array to store all the second derivatives i.e. the Hessian matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher order and mixed derivatives, specifically second order derivatives can then be used to determine the concavity, convexity, the points of inflection, and local extrema of functions. As pointed out earlier it can also be used to compute the Laplacian operator which is useful in describing many different phenomena, from electric potentials, to the diffusion equation for heat and fluid flow, and quantum mechanics.\n",
